## typingrace-nabiraem-bot

A bot for [typingrace.nabiraem.ru][1] game competition on fast typing.

Python 3.x only (for Python 2.x backward compatibility see [this][2]).

Supports only English and Russian keyboard languages.

### Installation & Usage

1. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.
   If you are a Linux user, you may experience issues with `pyautogui`.
   See [pyautogui docs][3] for installation details.
2. Configure `constants.py` file:
  * Set `TEXT_LANGUAGE`, `BUTTON`, `RACES`, `INTERVAL` game constants.

  * Set game elements' coordinates and pixels' RGB colors according to your
    screen resolution, OS and browser. `pyautogui.displayMousePosition()`
    function could be of great help to deal with that.
    Also, see *Images* directory for some help on finding the game elements' regions.

3. Feel free to experiment with setting different values to the `INTERVAL`
   constant to adjust typing speed.
4. To interrupt the program and regain control of the mouse, move the mouse to the top-left corner of your screen.

5. Have some fun winning races with incredible scores!
